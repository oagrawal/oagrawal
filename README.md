# Hey! üëã  
My name is **Om Agrawal**, and I am studying Computer Science at **UT Austin**.  

I am currently working on designing a **resource allocation mechanism** to reduce the variability in encoding time for input modalities, minimizing pipeline bubbles in multimodal AI models as part of the **UT Networked Systems research group**. Additionally, I am collaborating with the **Federal Aviation Administration**, developing algorithms and data science tools to detect GPS anomalies. Previously, I served as a **Teaching Assistant** for Discrete Mathematics in the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin.
