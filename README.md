### Hey! üëã
My name is Om Agrawal, and I am studying CS at UT Austin.  <br>

I am working on designing a resource allocation mechanism to reduce the variability in encoding time for input modalities,
reducing pipeline bubbles in multimodal AI models at the UT Networked Systems research group. I am working for the Federal Aviation Administration, 
creating algorithms and data science tools for detecting GPS anomlies. Previously, I have been a TA for discrete mathematics at the department of 
computer science at UT Austin.
