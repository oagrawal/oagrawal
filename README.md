# Hey! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m **Om Agrawal**, a Computer Science student at **UT Austin**.  

Iâ€™m developing a **resource allocation mechanism** to optimize encoding time and reduce pipeline bubbles in multimodal AI models with the **UT Networked Systems research group**. I also work with the **Federal Aviation Administration** on algorithms and tools for detecting GPS anomalies. Previously, I was a **Teaching Assistant** for Discrete Mathematics at UT Austin.
